# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
# To run this app:

### `git clone https://github.com/srs-sudeep/srs-sudeep.github.io.git`

### `cd srs-sudeep.github.io.git`

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

As a bonus I have also deployed it in the git hub pages to make use of innovative and some creative usage of git.
